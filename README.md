# Interactive_Graphics


Recommended platforms for screen-based interactive graphics that can communicate with physical computing systems such as sensors, microcontrollers and cameras.

All the following are Open-Source and Free-to-Use.


p5.js: Creative coding for interactive art, rapid prototyping, data visualisation.

Processing: Prototyping, expressive generative visuals.

----

**Three.js:** 

Web-based 3D graphics, interactive product visuals, online exhibitions, and browser-delivered installations. 

Ideal when your project is online and requires 3D interactivity.

----

Touch Designer: Physically interactive installations, motion graphics, real-time data art and sensor-integrated artwork. *Free version available with limitations. 

Unity / Unreal: Full interactive environments, immersive experiences, XR, large installations that need high performance.

**p5.js** and **Processing** remain very strong for teaching, prototyping and creative experimentation. They’re widely used in education, interactive art projects, generative visuals, and early prototyping of ideas. Not usually used for high-end commercial experiences or large scale installations on its own, but excellent for prototyping the concept before moving to more advanced tools.

**Three.js** Highly relevant for web-delivered 3D graphics. Big companies, galleries and creative studios use it for interactive web visuals, online exhibitions and browser experiences.

**TouchDesigner** Very strong in live visuals, installations, interactive performances, projection mapping and responsive environments.

**Unity / Unreal**Extremely strong — these are major realtime graphics engines used in games, XR (AR/VR), interactive installations and experiential applications.
