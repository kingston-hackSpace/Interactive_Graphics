# Interactive Graphics


The following list presents platforms for **screen-based interactive graphics that can communicate with physical computing systems** such as sensors, microcontrollers and cameras.

All platforms listed are either **open source or free** (some with limitations).

----
# p5.js:

Best used for **2D (and simple 3D) interactive graphics in the browser**. 

Suitable for simple interactions through the mouse, keyboard, webcam and audio.

Further interactions with sensors (via microcontrollers or Raspberry Pi) requires WebSockets, APIs or server bridges.

Good choice when a project needs to run online and respond to user input or live data, without complex 3D requirements.

Open-Source and Free.

# Processing:

Best used for screen-based **interactive graphics in a desktop environment** (not in the browser). 

Suitable for simple interactions through the mouse, keyboard, webcam and audio.

Simple interaction with sensors (via microcontrollers or Raspberry Pi) using Serial or OSC communication. 

Requires local software installation; available for Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

Open-Source and Free.

----
# Three.js:

Best used for **browser-based 3D graphics and interactive projects** that require spatial or three-dimensional interaction online. Suitable for more complex 3D interaction than p5.js

Ideal when your project is online and requires 3D interactivity.

Supports interaction through the mouse, keyboard, webcam and audio.

Further interactions with sensors (via microcontrollers or Raspberry Pi) requires WebSockets, APIs or server bridges.

Open-Source and Free.

# Touch Designer:

Best used for **real-time interactive installations, motion graphics and sensor-driven artworks**. 

Supports interaction through the mouse, keyboard, webcam and audio.

Simple interaction with sensors (via microcontrollers or Raspberry Pi) using Serial or OSC communication. 

Requires local software installation; available for Windows and MacOS.

Free to use with limitations.

# Unity / Unreal

Unity and Unreal are widely used in **games and immersive experiences (VR/AR)**. 

Can integrate with sensors, cameras and microcontrollers via plugins or custom bridges.

Both powerful but have a steeper learning curve and are best suited to larger or more technically complex projects.

Requires software local intallation; available for Windows and MacOS.

Free to use with limitations.

Industry relevance: 
----

**p5.js** and **Processing** are widely used in education, interactive art projects, generative visuals, and early prototyping of ideas. Not usually used for high-end commercial experiences or large scale installations on its own, but excellent for prototyping the concept before moving to more advanced tools.

**Three.js** Highly relevant for web-delivered 3D graphics. Big companies, galleries and creative studios use it for interactive web visuals, online exhibitions and browser experiences.

**TouchDesigner** Very strong in live visuals, installations, interactive performances, projection mapping and responsive environments.

**Unity / Unreal** Extremely strong — these are major realtime graphics engines used in games, XR (AR/VR), interactive installations and experiential applications.
