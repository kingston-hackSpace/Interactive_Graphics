# Interactive_Graphics


Recommended platforms for screen-based interactive graphics that can communicate with physical computing systems such as sensors, microcontrollers and cameras.

All platforms listed are either **open source** or offer **free versions suitable for learning and prototyping**.

----
## p5.js:

p5.js is best used for 2D (and simple 3D) interactive graphics **in the browser**. 

Supports interaction through the mouse, keyboard, webcam and audio, as well as microcontrollers and Raspberry Pi. 

It is a good choice when a project needs to run online and respond to user input or live data.

Open-Source and Free.

## Processing:

Processing is best used for screen-based interactive graphics in a **desktop environment**. 

Supports interaction through the mouse, keyboard, webcam and audio, as well as microcontrollers and Raspberry Pi. 

Open-Source and Free.

----
## Three.js:

Three.js is best used for browser-based 3D graphics and interactive projects that require spatial or three-dimensional interaction online.

Ideal when your project is online and requires 3D interactivity.

Suitable for more complex 3D interaction than p5.js

Can connect to physical computing systems via WebSockets, APIs or server bridges

Open-Source and Free.

----
## Touch Designer:

TouchDesigner is best used for real-time interactive installations, motion graphics and sensor-driven artworks. It is particularly effective for projects that rely on continuous real-time input from cameras, sensors or audio systems.

Excellent for working with cameras, sensors, audio, MIDI, OSC and DMX

Free to use with limitations.

## Unity / Unreal

Unity and Unreal are widely used in games and immersive experiences (VR/AR). 

Can integrate with sensors, cameras and microcontrollers via plugins or custom bridges

Unity: free personal licence (with limitations)

Unreal Engine: free to use; royalties apply for commercial products

Industry relevance: 
----

**p5.js** and **Processing** remain very strong for teaching, prototyping and creative experimentation. They’re widely used in education, interactive art projects, generative visuals, and early prototyping of ideas. Not usually used for high-end commercial experiences or large scale installations on its own, but excellent for prototyping the concept before moving to more advanced tools.

**Three.js** Highly relevant for web-delivered 3D graphics. Big companies, galleries and creative studios use it for interactive web visuals, online exhibitions and browser experiences.

**TouchDesigner** Very strong in live visuals, installations, interactive performances, projection mapping and responsive environments.

**Unity / Unreal**Extremely strong — these are major realtime graphics engines used in games, XR (AR/VR), interactive installations and experiential applications.
